            <p>Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) are toxic contaminants of concern. Currently, efforts to detect
                new PFAS products in clinical sampling relies on manual data analysis with poor discovery rates. PIMMS
                was
                developed to accelerate this workflow, prioritizing and vizualizing features of interest. PIMMS is a
                novel software and has already been used to identify emerging PFAS in animals and humans. Already, PIMMS
                has been able to reduce a workflow that takes months to days enabling a more indepth investigation into
                the exposure we face from PFAS.<br>Currently unreleased until licensing is agreed. Anticipated release
                in April 2025</p>

            <p>Recent evidence has linked several PFAS to adverse health outcomes, a potential link is feared between
                PFAS exposure and the onset of autoimmune disease. Previous epidemiological studies have only been able
                to rely exclusively on "target" analysis, focusing on a handful of already extensively characterized
                PFAS. This project is an entirely new approach to epidemiological PFAS studies using a "non-targeted"
                all features approach to identify new PFAS of concern in individuals and establish links to 5 of the
                most concerning autoimmune diseases in the US.</p>
